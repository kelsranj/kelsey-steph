## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

```{r}
lobster_traps <- read_csv("data/Lobster_Trap_Counts_All_Years_20210519.csv")
```
```{r}
lobster_traps <- read_csv("../data/Lobster_Trap_Counts_All_Years_20210519.csv")
```
## removing missing data

```{r}
lobster_traps <- lobster_traps %>% 
    mutate(TRAPS = na_if(TRAPS, -99999))
```

#excercise data visualization
```{r}
ggplot(data = lobster_traps, aes(x = TRAPS)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    facet_wrap( ~ YEAR)
```

##line graph data summary
```{r}
lobsters_traps_summarize <- lobster_traps %>% 
  group_by(SITE, YEAR) %>% 
  summarize(TOTAL_TRAPS = sum(TRAPS, na.rm = TRUE))
head(lobsters_traps_summarize)
head(lobster_traps)
```

## part 2 line graph 
```{r}
# line plot
ggplot(data = lobsters_traps_summarize, aes(x = YEAR, y = TOTAL_TRAPS)) +
    geom_line(aes(color = SITE))

# line and point plot
ggplot(data = lobsters_traps_summarize, aes(x = YEAR, y = TOTAL_TRAPS)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = SITE)) +
    geom_line(aes(color = SITE))
```
